# ta-sobo.gerhardla.nz

Designed and developed by Gerhard, [ta-sobo.gerhardla.nz](ta-sobo.gerhardla.nz) went online in 2024. This subdomain serves as the landing page for  Te Araroa Southbound â€” a daily newsletter on walking [Te Araroa](https://www.teararoa.org.nz/) (The Long Pathway) in New Zealand. Te Araroa Southbound is time-bound and will operate only while I am on the trail, after which it will be archived.
